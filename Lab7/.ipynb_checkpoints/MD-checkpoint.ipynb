    "[Protein structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure) is the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a protein, which is a chain of amino acids. Proteins are polymers – specifically polypeptides – formed from sequences of 20 types of amino acids, the monomers of the polymer. A single amino acid monomer may also be called a residue, indicating a repeating unit of a polymer. To be able to perform their biological function, proteins fold into one or more specific spatial conformations driven by a number of non-covalent interactions such as:\n",

    "- hydrogen bonding \n",
    "- ionic interactions \n",
    "- Van der Waals forces\n",

    "\n",
    "**Primary structure** of a protein refers to the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain.\n",

    "**Secondary structure** refers to highly regular local sub-structures of the actual polypeptide backbone chain. There are two main types of secondary structure: the α-helix and the β-strand or β-sheets.\n",

    "**Tertiary structure** refers to the three-dimensional structure of monomeric and multimeric protein molecules. The α-helixes and β-sheets are folded into a compact globular structure. \n",

    "**Quaternary structure** is the three-dimensional structure consisting of two or more individual polypeptide chains (subunits) that operate as a single functional unit (multimer).\n",

    "- *Antibodies* - bind to specific foreign particles, ex: IgG \n",
    "- *Enzymes* - speed up chemical reactions, ex: Lysozyme\n",
    "- *Messengers* - transmit signals, ex: Growth hormone \n",
